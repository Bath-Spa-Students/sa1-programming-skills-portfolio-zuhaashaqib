#Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

'''In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console.'''



#performing arithmetic operations by using variables
a = 8   #first variable is assigned with the value '8'
b = 10  #second variable is assigned with the value '10'
c = a + b  #third variable is assigned with the sum of first 2 variables
print(c)   #using print statement for the output
